              <p>I had the pleasure of managing Andrew for three years at We Make Websites. As a Product Owner, Andrew consistently exceeded expectations with his technical expertise and deep understanding. His ability to navigate complex projects and collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams was invaluable. Client feedback also was also stellar. 
              I highly recommend him for any role that requires a skilled and dedicated Product Owner.</p>

                One of his unique qualities as a Product Owner is his knowledge and passion for understanding the technical aspects alongside the developers. This comprehensive view makes creating designs easier, as he has a 360-degree perspective on everything.
