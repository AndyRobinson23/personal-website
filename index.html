              <p>I had the pleasure of managing Andrew for three years at We Make Websites.<br>
                As a Product Owner Andrew consistently exceeded expectations with his technical expertise and deep understanding of the platform. His ability to navigate complex projects and collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams was invaluable. Client feedback also was also stellar. Andrew is a true team player who always goes the extra mile to ensure project success. He's also just a great guy and I'd happily work with him again in the future if the opportunity came up. I highly recommend him for any role that requires a skilled and dedicated Product Owner.</p>

              <p>I had the pleasure of working with Andrew Robinson at We Make Websites, where he was the Product Owner on a number of builds I supported as a web developer. Andrew stood out immediately for his sharp technical understanding and clear communication. He consistently translated complex requirements into actionable tasks and collaborated seamlessly across disciplines.<br>
              We also had several 1:1 sessions focused on Shopify development, and I was always impressed by his eagerness to deepen his technical skills and ask thoughtful, relevant questions. His combination of strategic product thinking and hands-on technical knowledge made him a huge asset to any team. I'd love to work with him again.</p>
